# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object oriented programming is a style of programming that focuses on data and object rather than logic or functions.

Researched answer: Object oriented programming is a programming style that focuses on data and objects. This method comes with plenty of reusable code that can help streamline the process making it a scalable and collaborative-friendly approach to programming. OOP utilizes classes and objects to handle instances of logging multiple things and having them perform the same actions, these classes act as blueprints for the structure of the methods and attributes passed. 

1. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: An integer is a a regular number whether negative or positive but a Float is a a negative or positive number with a decimal.

Researched answer: Integers and floats are both types of numerical data, the main difference between the two is that inters are whole numbers wheras floats are integers. Floats are used to get a more accurate and precise numerical value because floats have a higher maximum value due to the fact they allow for larger exponents/values. 

1. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: An implicit return is a method of returning values from a function without specifically writing return, it has pre built in code to recognize what you are trying to do with less input needed when compared to javascript/react.

Researched answer: An implicit return is a return that implies the concept of return without explicitly writing out it out. This can be achieved through the use of arrow functions and occasionally parenthesis although because it is an implicit return there are cases where the parenthesiss are not required. An example of this would be if you only had one parameter in the arrow function. In any other case, multiple parameters would need to be wrapped in parenthesis.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into a method. Occasionally they will contain arguments that can be defined by two pipe characters (Example: |x| )

Researched answer: Blocks are similar to methods but they do not belong to an object. Blocks are set in a do/end statement or between brackets, they can also hold multiple arguments separated by tow pipe | characters. These are useful because they allow you to save bits of code and reuse them later expediting the process when comparing two elements for example. 

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: To extract a value in a Ruby hash you have to log the name of the hash with the key name set within brackets and following a colon (example- p palindrome[:racecar])

Researched answer: In Ruby the values in hashes can be accessed using bracket notation after the hash name you can type the name of the key. Extracting the value would look like this "p recipe[:sugar]". This is useful when you only need to display bits and pieces of the hash. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is when a class derives from another class, the child case is essentially gathering its properties and methods from the parent class.

2. RSpec: RSpec is a testing tool written into Ruby to test the code. 

3. CRUD: Acronym for persistent storage that stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete.

4. Test-driven development: Method of software developement that focuses on turning software requirements into tests and tracking all the software developement by testing the software against all cases.

5. HTTP: HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents, the acronym stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
